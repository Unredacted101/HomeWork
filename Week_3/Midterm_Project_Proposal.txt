Midterm Project Proposal: 

For this project I was thinking I am going to do a profolio website that displays various digital paintings/drawing I did.
In the main page, I would like to have a panel that cycles through all the works I had done. On the side there should be 
tabs that are categorized by date.The tabs will then link to a page that has all the works I did for that Month. In terms of 
what I need to learn the main thing will be how to create an image file that shuffles thorugh various images. I would also
have to to lean about linking pages through tabs and having the tabs change color when hovered on.
